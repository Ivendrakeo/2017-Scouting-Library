Comments should be styled according to the following:

        CoreFile.Constants.TEAM_NUMBER_FIELDS  """

    Function Comments:
        Triple quotes with 2 spaces following. Use full sentences to describe what the function does. Then have 1 blank
        line and tab each argument. Style each argument using "arg_name :" with a description following. If an argument
        requires a list tab the following row 1 further and style with "opt_name -" with a description following. If
        the function returns something, it should be specified using the return : key.
        Ex:
        """ Registers form radio options and specifies how they should be ranked.

            rank_statistic : form value of given radio_name that is identical to
                a RANK_HEADER name which is desired to be ranked by
            rank_order : how the data should be ranked. Currently the only supported field options are
                one of the following.
                    'descending' - Ranking from best to worst
                    'ascending' - Ranks from worst to best
                    'category' - Ranks given a tuple (category_options) of all possible submission data
                    for the supplied rank_statistic category. Intended to be used for ranking based on a
                    priority of strings. """
